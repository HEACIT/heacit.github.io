# Contributing

Great that you are interested in contributing to the HEACIT website.
In this file, we explain how you can contribute and what we expect 
from you.

## HEACIT membership

First of all, you need to be a member of the HEACIT group before you
can have your Github account added to the HEACIT organization. Please
have a look at our [Charter](https://heacit.github.io/charter.html) 
and [Membership](https://heacit.github.io/member.html) page. 

## Suggesting website content

The HEACIT website is generated using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
If you are comfortable using Sphinx, then you can create a new branch,
add your content, and create a git pull request (see explanation below). 

If you do not know Sphinx and just want us to add or change something on the
website, then please [create an issue in this respository](https://github.com/HEACIT/heacit.github.io/issues/new).

Please only submit content that is in line with the topics mentioned in the
[HEACIT Charter](https://heacit.github.io/charter.html). Also our 
[Rules of conduct](https://heacit.github.io/charter.html#rules-of-conduct)
apply to all interactions on our website and our repositories on the Github platform.

### Creating issues

If you have a Github account, then you can [create a new 
issue](https://github.com/HEACIT/heacit.github.io/issues/new) by clicking the link.
Please give your issue a clear title, like "SIXTE Workshop 2024 announcement",
describe your suggestion, and provide text and images if possible. Images
can be added as an attachment to the issue. Click the paperclip on the top toolbar
of the text window. Click the "Submit issue" button to submit the issue.

We will look at the submitted issue as soon as possible.

### Submitting changes through git

If you have a Github account and you are a member of the HEACIT Github organization,
then you can edit the relevant file on Github, or clone the repository on your local 
machine. Please create a new branch with a clear name, for example ``sixte_wshop_2024``
and [commit your changes to that branch](https://graphite.dev/guides/git-commit-to-new-branch).

When you have saved the file on Gihub or pushed your commit to the repository, the 
Github website should show the option to create a "pull request" for the branch.
Please give the pull request a descriptive title and motivate your change in the
pull request form. Once you submit your pull request, we will review it as 
quickly as possible. 

When the changes are committed to the ``main`` branch by one of the maintainers, the
website will be automatically updated using a Github CI job.
