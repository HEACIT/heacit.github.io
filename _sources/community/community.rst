Community engagement
====================

Provide forums for community engagement, where users can learn how to use
existing tools, exchange tips and tricks, informally report bugs and fixes,
discuss new tools or updates to existing ones, and perhaps start new
collaborations. Such sites may also be used to collect use cases for
:ref:`Future analysis methods`.
