SIXTE Workshop 2024

We are happy to announce our next hands-on SIXTE workshop taking place
November 6th to 8th 2024 at SRON in Leiden.

SIXTE is a software package for simulations of X-ray observations, which
is used as the official end-to-end simulator for both current and future
X-ray missions such as eROSITA and NewATHENA. It can also be used as a
tool for writing observing proposals for missions such as XRISM, as well
as for the scientific analysis of existing observations with strong
instrumental effects such as pileup.

The focus of the workshop is an introduction of SIXTE, including new
features that were added to the next major release of SIXTE, SIXTE
version 3. The workshop is therefore well suited to both, experienced
and new users of SIXTE. A focus of the workshop will be on simulations
for XRISM Resolve and Xtend and NewATHENA WFI and X-IFU, as well as
other future X-ray missions.
