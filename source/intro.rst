Introduction
============

The HEACIT collaboration is a working group that seeks to identify how the landscape
of astrophysical software enables or can improve the impact of high energy astrophysical
data. This includes maximizing the return of current and future observations, as well as
increasing their usability and interoperability with datasets at other wavelengths.

HEACIT is not technically associated with any particular software package, but HEACIT
members include developers of high energy software packages such as XSPEC, SPEX, Sherpa,
and ISIS. The goal of the working group is to connect developers, align on standard
practices and collaborate on future development, while allowing for and preserving the
diversity of available high energy tools and workflows.

The current HEACIT Chair is Jelle de Plaa. The HEACIT Steering Committee includes the
HEACIT Chair, Randall Smith, Tess Jaffe, and Michael Wise.
