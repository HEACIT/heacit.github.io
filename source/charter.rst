Charter

Created: July 22, 2021

Science Context
---------------

The landscape of Astrophysical research is moving increasingly towards
multi-wavelength observation and large datasets, requiring large
collaborations and information sharing in order to achieve our best
possible understanding of the Universe. At the same time, new science
areas are opening due to the development of technologies and techniques
for performing measurements with incredible precision (c.f., exoplanet
observations, the Event Horizon Telescope, and the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and for new kinds of data analysis (such
as AI/ML algorithms).

The HEACIT (High Energy Astrophysics Codes, Interfaces, and Tools)
collaboration is a self-appointed working group
that seeks to identify how the landscape of astrophysical software
enables or can improve the impact of high energy astrophysical data.
This includes maximizing the return of current and future observations,
as well as increasing their usability and interoperability with datasets
at other wavelengths.


Mission Drivers
---------------

The majority of high-energy spectroscopic data analysis hinges on the visualization
and fitting of 1D histograms of X-ray data (0.1 - 150 keV), typically measured in
instrument-specific ‘counts’. Time variability of these datasets is minimally
addressed and has not yet converged on a standard tool or procedure. Next generation
astronomical X-ray technologies include (1) the ability to obtain high resolution
spectroscopic datacubes for a 2D image where each pixel is a spectrum, potentially
time-variable, and (2) a factor of 3-50 increase in spectroscopic resolution. Further
advances in X-ray instrumentation will also soon allow for the examination of X-ray
polarization. All of these factors increase the size, complexity, and computational
resources needed to interpret future datasets. HEACIT seeks to identify gaps in the
current software landscape and encourage development of tools that will enable the
maximal science return of next generation X-ray observatories.


Main Tasks
----------

1. Identify commonalities among different X-ray data analysis tools in order to develop, refine, and encourage interoperable APIs and workflows. Facilitate communication among software developers and coordinate efforts to converge on standard formats for support structures, such as atomic databases and instrumental calibration and characterization.
2. Identify use cases for science that is currently difficult to perform with existing high energy software tools available.
3. Identify and encourage best practices for X-ray data manipulation, analysis, and publication. Identify and promote sustainable software practices.
4. Provide forums for community engagement, where users can learn how to use existing tools, exchange tips and tricks, informally report bugs and fixes, discuss new tools or updates to existing ones,  and perhaps start new collaborations. Such sites may also be used to collect use cases for Task #2.

HEACIT members may lead white papers (cf., Chen et al. 2021), special conference
sessions, or workshops regarding any of the above topics.


Organization
------------

HEACIT will have a Chair and a Steering Committee consisting of the Chair and three
other HEACIT members. The Chair will serve as a point of contact for the HEACIT and
organize meetings. The Steering Committee will review membership applications and
will have authoritative power in case of disputes or violations of the HEACIT rules
of conduct.

The Chair is appointed by the Steering Committee members for a 2-year term. At the end
of each 2-year term, the Steering Committee (minus the current Chair) can choose to
renew the current Chair or select a new Chair.

There are no formal term limits on Steering Committee membership, although the
expectation is that membership will be reviewed every three years. In the case of
a Steering Committee member vacating their position, self nominations will be
solicited from the HEACIT membership. Such nominations should include a brief
explanation of why the individual wishes to join the Steering Committee of the
HEACIT and what they’d bring to the Committee.

The inaugural Chair is Lia Corrales, and the inaugural members of the Steering
Committee are Randall Smith, Michael Wise, and Tess Jaffe.

Individual tasks will be led by specified members of HEACIT, who will be responsible
for managing the subgroup.

Rules of Conduct
----------------

- All group members agree to abide by the code of ethics and anti-harassment rules as
  set forth by the AAS, which has also been adopted for HEAD meetings. Incidents can
  be brought to any member of the Steering Committee. Violations can lead to a verbal
  warning or removal from HEACIT.

- All group members pledge to treat everyone interacting with the HEACIT community with
  respect. Discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies, programming
  languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be done with respect, taking
  proactive measures to ensure that all participants are heard and feel confident
  that they can freely express their opinions. All group members agree not to promote or deride any particular software tools as  inherently “better” or  “worse” than others.

- HEACIT is not a research team unto itself. However, individual members may choose to
  collaborate and form research groups as a result of HEACIT discussions. Such
  collaboration is understandable and encouraged.

- Communication regarding HEACIT meetings and tasks will primarily be done via the
  HEACIT mailing list that will include all members and via a monthly telecon.
  Members are encouraged to take HEACIT discussions regarding specific software
  tools and problems to the forum (Task #4) so that the conversation can be publicly
  accessible, archived, and searchable.

- White paper authorship list: Any member of HEACIT is welcome and encouraged to
  lead white papers regarding topics discussed within the HEACIT group. In that case,
  it is recommended that the authors circulate the white paper draft to the HEACIT
  group to allow individual working group members a chance to sign onto the authorship
  list as endorsers. It is recommended that the lead and corresponding author be listed
  as the first author on the paper.

- HEACIT will have a shared Google Drive folder to facilitate information distribution.
  This site will be available to all members.

Membership Policy
-----------------

Community members will be directly invited to become a HEACIT member by deliberation
of the Steering Committee. Anyone can submit a nomination by notifying  the Chair,
who will provide the instructions to the nominee for applying for HEACIT Membership.
Self-nominations are allowed and encouraged; simply fill out the application form
linked on the :ref:`Membership` page. The application responses go directly to the
Chair, who will then review it with the Steering Committee.

Applications for HEACIT Membership require the following:
 - A statement that the applicant agrees to abide by  the HEACIT Charter,
 - A description of the applicant’s scientific background, research interest and
   expertise, and expected/planned contribution to HEACIT.

Updating the Charter
--------------------

The Steering Committee is responsible for providing updates to the HEACIT Charter as
needed to reflect any changes in the working group process or activities. At a minimum,
the Charter will be reviewed and updated every three years. The latest date of review
or revision is recorded at the top of the document.
