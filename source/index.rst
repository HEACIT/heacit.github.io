The HEACIT working group
========================

This is the main website of the High-Energy Astrophysics Code, Interfaces
and Tools (HEACIT) working group. The HEACIT collaboration seeks to identify how the
landscape of astrophysical software enables or can improve the impact of
high energy astrophysical data. This includes maximizing the return of
current and future observations, as well as increasing their usability and
interoperability with datasets at other wavelengths.
